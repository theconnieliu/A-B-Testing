    <br>
    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>How impactful are design principles on the communication of the affordances of a website? 
      How do they impact the behavior of users?
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of this assignment in CS1300 was to perform an A/B test and statistical analysis
      to gather insight into two different UI designs of a succulent plant shop.

    <p>Read on for the process of my A/B Testing!</p>

    <h2>Making and Deploying the Websites</h2>
    <p>In this case study, I created two versions of a succulent shop website. Visit my site <a href = "https://cryptic-ocean-12798.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.</p>
    <p><b>Differences:</b> While Site A is derived strictly
      from a template, void of any formatting, Site B differs in that it implement better <b>spacing, stylization, and 
      differentiation</b> between the elements of the website, such as its photos, buttons, and labels.

    <h2>Creating Hypotheses for Statistical Tests</h2>
    <p>
      With these two versions of the website, I created both a <b>null</b> and <b>alternative</b> hypothesis for both 
      sites from which I could derive answers based on the results of my study. I paid special attention to their <b>Time of Completion</b>
      of their task and their <b>Return Rate</b> to my website.

            <p><b>Alternate:</b> I hypothesize that the time of completion on Site B will be decreased, for the proper and relevant buttons 
              to the operations possible in the website are more visible and easy to access than before.</p>

              will make it easier for users to complete their tasks and move on with their day, negating the necessity to return.</p>

    <h2>Collecting Data and Applying Scripts</h2>
    <p>To put this to the text, I the link to my websites to my peers. When they clicked on the link, there was a <b>50% chance that it would 
      open Site A, and a 50% chance that it would open Site B</b>. Once they arrived to a site, they added at least $150 worth of 
      plants to their cart. This would return data about the version they’d open and the times and rates at which they clicked 
      on the site to a log on my computer. 
    </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Example of collected logs:</h4> 
      <p>It may look confusing and intimidating, but from this we can deduce the exact actions a user took while interacting
        with the website, including its <b>initial load time</b>, the <b>buttons they clicked</b>, and the <b>time it took for them to complete their task</b>!
      </p>

        <img class= "wireframe" alt= "Screenshot of data logs" src= "images/log.png">
      </div>
</div>
    <br>
    <p>Running this data through my python scripts produced <b>t-scores and p-values for the users' time of completion</b>, as well as
      <b>t-scores and chi^2 values for the users' return rate</b>.</p>
    <hr>
    <br>
    
    <h2>Conclusions + Infographic</h2>
    <p>From the collected t-scores, chi^2 values, and p-values of my data, I was able to determine not only the differences 
      of performance between each site, but also whether or not the results were significant.

    <h2>Takeaways + Lessons Learned:</h2>
    <h4>Broad Takeaways</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>My lack of time to create a drastic and meaningful difference between the versions of my site definitely contributed 
          to the lack of statistical significance to my results. </li>
          <br>
        <li>The lack of a large enough sample size of users also impacted the results of my test, as having a larger sample size 
          would’ve produced a better model of the assortment of users that would be interacting with my site.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>My results were not significant enough to draw any broad conclusions about design principles and their effects on users, but perhaps we may conclude on a tentative level that at least in the isolated case of this study, these results show that tiny changes as small as the alignment of buttons next to a product page don’t produce significant changes in a user’s time of completion or return rate. 
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
    <p>
      I'd never tried conducting an A/B Test or delving into statistics before, so I definitely learned something new at every step
      during this process. It was good to hve something concrete to make decisions and conclusions off of, instead of strictly
      subjective choices based on visual design preferences. Data and numbers from collected data from users definitely added to the 
      solidity of design choices, and I'm very thankful to have gotten to complete this project!
